# Newsletter - REST API

This is the REST API built for the project using FastAPI and Python 3.9

## ðŸ’» Installation

This API can be deployed by the docker-compose file or by building an image using it's DockerFile and runing it. But in case that it needs to be deployed without containers, it can be done using the following steps:

**For Windows:**

```bash
# Creation of a Virtual Environment
py -m venv venv

# Activation of Virtual Environment
./venv/Scripts/activate

# Installation of dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execution in a development environment
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**For Linux/MacOS:**

```bash
# Creation of a Virtual Environment
py -m venv venv

# Activation of Virtual Environment
venv/bin/activate

# Installation of dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execution in a development environment
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This project uses MongoDB as it's database, so it needs to be installed as well.
